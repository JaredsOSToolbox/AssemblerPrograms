# Satellite Decryption Program

This program simply decrypts a packet given by a satellite orbiting Mars.
It is broken down into three different steps:

- [X] Reading in the file
- [X] Decrypt the packet
- [X] Print contents of decrypted packets

A C solution is also provided, which is more clear of what is actually going on.
